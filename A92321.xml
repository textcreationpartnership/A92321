            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </l>
               </q> Oh that we could ſee Gods face ſhining upon us in your Royal preſence! and with clear eyes look upon you as the man of Gods right hand. Doubtleſſe this was one of the myſteries of Divine providence, and one of the chiefeſt of the wayes of God. There doth want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the perfecting this bleſſing, but thankfulneſſe to God, and obedience to his known Laws. Who would not praiſe God for ſuch a mercy? who would not ſerve God for ſuch a Prince? Oh that we could prize you, as our felicity in you is prizeleſſe! Oh that we could ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, as he honoured us by you, making us in the ſight of the world his ſpecial Favourites! But I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that all this will be but a blaſt, and end in a lip-ſtrain. <hi>Ten may be cleanſed, but where are the nine?</hi> Nothing is more ſhort-lived, then the ſenſe of a recovery. Our maladies are even healed, and we begin to forget our cure; we ſcarcely magnifie our God, or value our King. What is the price of a good God? what is a true King worth? cloth of ſilver, chains of gold, ringing of bells, blowing of Trumpets, roaring of Ordnance, kindling of bonefires, a panegyrical Oration, a thankſgiving-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
<pb facs="tcp:119329:4"/> Is not here all out pomp? our chiefeſt devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what mortifying of corruptions, cleanſing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, vows of reformation, fruits of obedience are there to be ſeen amongſt us, more then formerly? no, we were affected onely for a time, or holy for a ſeaſon; ſome are again at their old frolicks, and ſome at their old Politicks. We are ſatiated both with our God, and our King. Never well without our King, and never the better when we have him. There are men, that will not forbear a curſed oath, a bowſing bowl, a cheat in the ſhop, a bribe in the Court, a ſeditious deſign, a factious meeting, to make the reign of ſuch a King peaceable, or the life of ſuch a King ſafe; they muſt either be Kings themſelves, or elſe no King doth pleaſe them. So that this high favour from heaven, is like to be but an ominous trial, an imminent and impending judgement. For how can God be but angry, if we be offended at our peace, or kick at his bleſſing? we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our welfare, and jeopard our King. Oh that we can forget our diſtractions before this ſettlement! and our deſpairing condition before God opened this door of hope in the land! with what ſobbes, and tears, would we have bought this calm, and comfortable ſtate, which we do now enjoy? Before your Majeſty came amongſt us we were a ſick Nation, viſited with <hi>Many Princes;</hi> and this <hi>Kings-evil</hi> nothing could have healed but the touch of your own Royal hand. By the bleſſing of God, and your Majeſties happy appearance, the <hi>Many Princes</hi> are turned into <hi>One.</hi> And is not this a change, a cure to be magnified and admired? yes, if we had either ſenſe of mercy, or conſcience of duty left in us, we would never ſinne again, but dread as much to be guilty, as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable.
<pb facs="tcp:119329:4"/> For we know, that it was <hi>the tranſgreſsion of the Land,</hi> that brought in the <hi>Many Princes,</hi> and will not we caſt away our tranſgreſſions to caſt out, and keep out ſuch <hi>Princes?</hi> were they once ſo odious, and are they now again become ſo precious? elſe why do we ſet open the right broad gates to give them entrance? is there any readier paſſage for them to break in amongſt us, then by your old corruptions? If we would preſerve <hi>the Man of underſtanding and knowledge,</hi> can there be a ſurer means of prevention of miſery, then by taking the right Antidote againſt <hi>Tranſgreſsion?</hi> For can <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion</hi> be prolonged, and the <hi>State</hi> prolonged? no, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries do expel each other.</hi> If the diſtemper be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the diſeaſe may renew. Our incorrigible ſins may endanger your Majeſties Royal perſon, and ſhed your Royal bloud. I do not fear ſo much the Malecontents at home, or the Machivilians abroad, as theſe Miſcreants of impiety, and impenitency. Some call their ſelves your Majeſties good Subjects, &amp; ſome your beſt Subjects, I would they would try their degrees of compariſon by a ſuperiority of repentance. Repentance? what ſhould we repent of? Some think onely of carnal ſins, but carnal ſins, are onely greater for turpitude, and infamy; <note place="margin">Tho.

<pb facs="tcp:119329:5"/> whole Nation; it is a rare thing to hear a King upon the Throne to teach all the Kingdome virtue, ſuch a King may be ſirnamed <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> ſuch a motion is able to ſanctifie a Land; eſpecially, when it is not onely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory, but exemplary, edged with as much piety as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; whereby all your people might aſcribe to you your attributes of <hi>Gratious Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi> Your Majeſty have done your part, freed your own ſoul, and endeavoured to cleanſe ours. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you (my dear and dread <hi>Soveraign</hi>) what opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have you found by that <hi>Masterpiece</hi> of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? how many Royal <hi>Converts</hi> have you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in? If you have, I will ſay that Majeſty doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome Soveraignty with it, and that your Crown is not more glorious, then your Scepter awfull; you are then a potent King, and have true loyal Subjects; then all Nations will flock hither more to ſee your virtue, your efficacious virtue, then ever they did to hear the wiſdome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſay that here do dwell the <hi>people of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> and that you do reign in a <hi>Kindome of Saints;</hi> which is not onely your proper <hi>Territory,</hi> but your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> a <hi>Temple</hi> which you have conſecrated by your own graces; yea then as <hi>Cyprus</hi> was once called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Oh rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating King then! Oh converting Proclamation! If men be thus really renewed, it is pity that they ſhould be reproached with any of their former errours, for none but a ſordid ſpirit will gather up that filth which repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath waſhed away: When the bond is cancelled, the former debts are no more to be required, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man is no more to be called a ſcandalous perſon, for then what comfort ſhould any man have in his change? or in ſtriking the mortifying nail into his breſt? it is as great a ſin to cenſure a Penitent, as to flatter a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine. Repentance doth give the exequies to all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer crimes; mortified crimes are to be buried, aſwell as dead corpſes. There are none but Necromancers, which will call up the ſpirits of the deceaſed to work their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall ends withall; there are none but ravenous dogs, which will ſatisfie their greedy appetites with ſuch Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion: for what can God, or man, require more of the greateſt Sinner, then reformation. Were it unprieſtly, unchriſtian, unmanly in me, to call any man Rebel who is become a Loyal Subject? or him an Heretick, or Schiſmatick, who is, turned Orthodox in doctrine, and diſcipline? then how ungodly and inhumane is it in any to call them profane, who have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves Converts? <hi>Mary Magdalen, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> would never have been, called Saints by theſe ſpiritual Murtherers of reformation; but repentance hath ſo rinſed a Penitent, that he is never after to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led filthy; <note place="margin">

No, we are too great Advocates to our own corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions to confeſſe the original of ſorrows to flow from our own prevarications; they are not our many ſinnes that are the occaſion of the many Princes, but there are many other accidents; ſome look to the malignancy of Planets, ſome to the improvidence of Stateſmen, ſome to the turbulency of mens natures; but Tranſgreſſion is not the procatarctical cauſe; No, the Land doth ſuffer, but the Land is innocent; it is the judgement of the Land, but not the treſpaſs of the Land; the tribulation of the Land, but not the tranſgreſſion of the

Thus all the judgements from heaven cannot awaken the ſinner out of the ſpirit of ſlumber; <hi>Ionas</hi> doth ſleep in the midſt of the Tempeſt, and he muſt be taken by lot, before he will acknowledge that the ſhip was ready to be caſt away for his ſake. <note place="margin">Pindarus.</note>

But when we have uſed all our ſubterfuges, our own guilts will be found to be the State-Troublers; if there be changes of Governours, it is the iniquity of the times, which hath buried the good Governours; if there be many Princes, it is the tranſgreſſion of the Land, that hath ſhewn to the Land theſe many ſtrange faces. <hi>For the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof:</hi> well, a breach is made, how ſhall it be cloſed up? mourn ye for your ſinnes, and the Land ſhall no longer mourn, take away the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Land, and the tryal of the Land is taken away; the many Princes are gone, and a good Prince come in their ſtead; a Prince indeed that ſhall cauſe the waſted Land to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, &amp; a decayed State to be prolonged; <hi>But by a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge, the ſtate thereof shall be prolonged.

But this Prince was too happy for the times, too good for the Land; the people having loſt their obedience, they loſt their Prince; the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the Land being turned into the tranſgreſſion of the Land, this Prince proved but ſhort-lived; he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by diſaſter, the ſinnes of the Land had filled this Nation full of troubles, his perſon full of hazards, and took away his precious peace, and at laſt took away his precious life; turned a Prince into a priſoner, and a Monarch into a Martyr; ſo that there remained nothing but to cry out after him, <hi>oh beate Seſti,</hi>

Alaſs, we have little holy amongſt us but the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or conſecrated but our Temples: we ſtudy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but learn nothing but Principles; and run to Lectures, but carry away nothing but obſervations: we pray, but all our Religion is in our Knees; and weep, but all our contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in a little ſalt water: we ſpeak much of the primitive truth, but any new faſhion, or old abomination is dearer unto us; we talk highly of the Goſpel, but the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was more perfect: we cry out againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> but their Beads and Crucifixes; Whipcord and Sackcloth; Roodlofts and Relicks; Holy Grains and Holy Water, have more ſelf-deniall in them, then our Sabboth-ſervices, or our morning exerciſes; our petitions, or our repetitions; our Monethly Sacraments, or our Quarterly Faſts. We have forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but the green Buſh on the Sign, is better then the Wine in the Cellar. Set aſide the noiſe of our Sermon Bells, and our Sanctuary Crowdes; the liſting up of our Eyes, &amp; liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Eares; the penning down of Notes, &amp; dropping forth Sentences; our magnifying of precious Truths, and admiring of gracious Teachers; the adoring of our own Saints, and the defying of all others as Reprobates; what ſincere piety is there amongſt us? nay what execrable impiety doth there not abound, where God and his Lawes, Chriſt &amp; his Goſpell, ſeem ſo much to be valued? Are we Proteſtants? wherein? but in proteſting againſt the Pope? Are we the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church? wherein? but in reforming our Title? It is an eaſie thing to give Names, or to take Names. Have we not limited all Sanctity to the rules of our own deviſing, &amp; to the modells of our own framing, to our own aſcriptions and ſubſcriptions, to the addicting our ſelves to particular
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119329:16"/> Doctors, and the principling our ſelves in particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, to our own Paradoxes of Government, and Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes of Worſhip? Is not Chriſtianity almoſt turned into theſe Mathematicks? and redemption it ſelf into theſe Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks? are not our own divinations almoſt as much ſet by, as Gods viſions? is not the <hi>fear of God taught by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men?</hi> ſhall not all be Saints which will uſe theſe things? ſhall any be Saints which will not ſubmit to them? Indeed in reſpect of the high cry about theſe things, there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionative Religion amongſt us; yea a man would think, that the Chair of Sanctity were in this Church, nay, that the Oracle of piety were in this Land.

And I pray what manner of Land are we now? a Land of innocency, or a Land of tranſgreſſion? I am loth to decide the queſtion, becauſe I find it to be more dangerous to ſpeak truth, then to be guilty, and to diſcover ſin, then to commit it.

If theſe things come to be glanced at, then the Miniſter is taught the boundaries of his calling, that he muſt preach nothing but repentance, faith, and Chriſt Jeſus; and I pray how repentance, if ye will not ſuffer us to bring you to a ſenſe of your manifeſt ſinnes? and how faith, if we muſt tell you ſtories of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; your brains are full of nothing but your old errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions? &amp; how Chriſt Jeſus, if we muſt aſſure to you a redeemer, &amp; ye make all other ſlaves? theſe mens repentance is nothing, but to have men lament the ſins againſt their own cauſe, &amp; their Faith is nothing but to have people learn their new principles of juſtification, &amp; their Chriſt Jeſus is nothing but to ſet up a Saviour of politicks, that they might by their <hi>Iure divino,</hi> keep whom they would from Church Livings, and ſeclude whom they would from the Sacrament. And yet under theſe neat pretences no ſins muſt be touched, or not their ſins; no, he that with an upright heart, and a bleeding Conſcience come to reprove ſuch ſins, as he finds are an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Proteſtant Religion, and have in their phyſnomy too much of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> cholerick complexion, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Coal-black, ſhall be counted but a Traducer, if not a Fury. <hi>Elias</hi> for this was counted the <hi>Troubler</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> a ſower of ſedition, and our Bleſſd Saviour one that had a Devil. Oh beloved, Gods Lawes are not abrogated, the curſes are as confounding as ever; guilts doe not alter with the times; we are not to be partakers of other mens ſins, and if we may not reprove manifeſt abominations, how ſhall we cleanſe your ſouls, and free our own?

This ſame dwarſing, and puſillating of ſin, ye ſee, is as old as <hi>Malachy: Malachy</hi> is a ſevere oppoſite to Temporizers, a deadly enemie to Neuters; if he had lived in theſe times, it would have been ſaid, that he had medled with State matters, &amp; he would have been called Malignant to his face; I would not have exempted him from a Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; nay perhaps he would have been caſt into Caitiff's hole, &amp; have had a lodging appointed for him in the Clink; he doth ſpare none, and yet he doth fright none; no, they have the wit to keep their courage, and to be as audacious as he was reſolute, and as impudent as he was impartial; let <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeak what he can, yet they will have a tongue, and endeavour to out-tongue him too: Let them marry the daughter of a ſtrange god, and rob the true God; deſpiſe his Ordinances, and defile his Holineſſe; have the blood of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents under their skirts, and make the ſcandals of the earth their boſome friends; yet all this is nothing, or as good as nothing: ſmall things in others would be high crimes, but theſe grand exorbitancies in them, are but miſtakes, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions, not worthy a wet eye, a bluſh in the cheeks, the ſetting a ſtep backward; for <hi>Return unto me, ſaith the Lord, but ye ſaid, wherein shall we return?</hi> Beware therefore, that ye do not like theſe hypocrites, varniſh over your decayed poſts, when inward rottenneſſe is within, and make your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wounds leſſe dangerous then they are, for they which ſlight ſin, will never be ſenſible of ſin.</p>

Do it for the love of your ſouls, do it for love to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for the land that hath been ſtained with tranſgreſſion, for the land which hath ſuffered for tranſgreſſion, and for the Land which may periſh by tranſgreſsion. Though a great part of the Land ſhould be impenitent, yet have ye <hi>repentance unto life;</hi> pacifie Gods wrath for your ſelves, and ſacrifice for your Countrey; ſo if greater judgements ſhould be reſerved for the land, and this Nation which will not be reformed muſt be weather-beaten again, yet ye may have an hiding place from the ſtorm, that if the deſtroying Angel ſhould ſmite on all ſides, your ſprinkled door-poſts may be paſt over, that ye may be taken like the two legs, or the piece of an ear out of the mouth of the Lion, or plucked like a brand out of the fire. Oh therefore ſearch and try your ways, and turn again unto the Lord, if iniquity be in your hands, put it far away, leave not an hoof in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſpare not one <hi>Amelekite</hi> but put the whole curſed race to the edge of the ſword, loath your ſelves

Oh remember, that there is no ſuch refuge as repentance, nor no ſuch Sanctuary as ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God cannot be angry with you if ye ſeek his favour by humiliation, or howſoever ingratiate your ſelves into him by reformation. It is ſin that is Gods profeſſed adverſary; take away this, and there is not a frown in Gods brow, nor a fret in his breſt; his razor is laid aſide, his vial of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſet by, his thunderbolts fall out of his hand.

Princes we would be, and Princes we have been, but now ejected by juſtice from heaven, and rejected with the ſhame of the whole world: O that our own fierce humors, and the Devils violent ſuggeſtions ſhould ſo far prevail with

We bluſh, we tremble at the thought of all the commotions we have raiſed, the waſts we have made, the blood we have ſhed, the peaceable land we have diſtracted, the innocent King we have murthered; his dead head doth ly bleeding before our eyes, his Ghoſt doth day and night torture us.

As a penitent thinks he can never do enough for his God, ſo a State-convert thinks he can never do enough for his King; he was never ſo much for his own State, as he will now be for Majeſty.

Was there ever any man, much leſſe any calling free from errour ſince the firſt fall? Is every thing that hath imperfections in it to be rejected? then how ſhould the world ſoone be without a man, and the Church without a Saint. I had then loſt my miniſtery, for I finde imperfections enough in my ſelf, and I believe that many others muſt be degraded with me and be called my ſliding brethren, yea many great Saints might be put into the ſinners Catalogue with me; <hi>Archives</hi> and <hi>Diptyckes, Synodical</hi> and Select Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations might have a Crowd of them which are guilty of lapſes, and relapſes; it is not the white ſurpleſſe, nor the white cap which can make men all white, they may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy much, but they often ſanctify but little; and if ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſinnes (as Divines hold) be greater then carnal, then where would my ſpiritual brethren be? I will not call them carnal Reprobates, but I doubt there is a Court might call them ſpiritual filths. The maine comfort to any of us is that we are Reformed, for to be reformed is as it were to have a new creation, yea to be new ſouled, and to have a new form.

In reformation there will be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and till we can get the unregenerate man quite mortifi'd there will be a viciſſitude of operations concerning grace, and corrupt nature; well then, Monarchy hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, what then? if thou canſt not be without fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, why ſhould Monarchy be rejected for debilities, and imbecillities? Feareſt thou not God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? till thou canſt get a pure conſcience cry not out too loudly for a pure Monarchy; but ſuppoſe that there have been errors, may not Monarchy turn a Convert? what ſhal not reformed Monarchy obtain thy pardon? what inflexible, inexorable to a Penitent? hard hearted Judge, I would not wiſh thy ſanctity to be tried at ſuch a barre; a ſcandalous perſon (whatſoever mad rage hath been uſed to ſuch perſons) ought not to be ejected, or rejected till he hath had his reiterated Church-warning; for doubtleſſe a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſon ought to have as much favour as an Heretick, who is not to be rejected till he hath been twice admoniſhed, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. Then ſhall Monarchy be a <hi>Contumax,</hi> when it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119329:41"/> hath been a Suppliant, and without the help of other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath cured her Itch by her own faſting ſpittle? what ſhall not Monarchy reformed have thy indulgence? what is there yet wanting? muſt it be thy convert, or elſe is it a Caſtaway? then the contention is not about the calling but the Owner; and I believe if Monarchy would ſubſcribe to thy Tenets, and ſeal thee Patents, and fight for thy Cauſe, Monarchy ſhould he held lawfull enough. Would'ſt thou be a friend to Monarchy, if it would be thy friend and Champion? Yes, thou wouldeſt not refuſe the name of Royaliſt, and write more <hi>Encomiums</hi> in the honour of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, then ever any (as thou calleſt them) of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes did; alas! men can change their opinions, or relaxe in their rigours, if it be for their ends, as eaſily as an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt</hi> can fight, poſſeſs Eſtates, pay Cuſtomes, or ſwear, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force ſevere oathes on others; It is not Monarchy therefore that is the quarrell, but that men cannot make Monarchy their own Monopoly. What a Saint might a Monarch be, if he could do two things, pleaſe parties, and get a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience! But if he will not ſubmit to this, then the imperfections of Monarchy ſhall be ſought out, and theſe ſhall be urged to blemiſh and blaſt it, but if the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be juſt of it ſelf, they are not imperfections which can aboliſh it. No, blame the errours, but not abrogate the function, will any man ſhut up his windowes, becauſe ſome men have caſt themſelves headlong out of them? or pluck down Pulpits, becauſe ſome men have preached falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in them? or refuſe to receive the Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men have been poyſoned by it? wilt thou kill thy horſe, becauſe he doth halt? or pull down thy houſe becauſe it hath a ſmoaky chimney? or pluck thy eye out of thy head becauſe it is blood-ſhotten? no, expell the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but honour the calling. Kingſhip in the State of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no damned Office, for the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> or great <hi>Turk</hi> are lawfull Kings, much leſs is Monarchy reformed a child of perdition; for though thou in the ſtate of regeneration art not an abſolute Sinner, yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119329:42"/> thou art not an abſolute Saint, what then? thou which in thy beſt mortal condition art an half Devil, wouldſt thou have a King a pure Angel? feareſt thou not God ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? I muſt ſhew thee the lees in thine own veſſell, and the husk that grows about thine own ſined wheat, or elſe I ſhall never ſtrike thee mute from clamouring againſt Monarchy. All Governments have their frailties, but none fewer then Monarchy: we have had trial of thy ſeveral forms, and find them more deformed then that which thou wouldſt have looked upon with a loathing eye, as a <hi>Morian.</hi> The wiſe God no doubt knew this very well, and therefore he inſtituted Monarchy as the calling moſt approved by himſelf, and which he knew leaſt obnoxious to culpableneſſe; as he himſelf is but one God, ſo he would have but one Subſtitute to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him upon earth; he is not for <hi>Men,</hi> but for <hi>a Man.

If a Prince miſcarry in any thing it is the Bruit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the diſcourſe of every Lackey, and Frippery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Councel-chambers will cry out of it, as if every

Nay if they cannot queſtion their Princes actions, they will his intentions, or if they cannot make him criminal, they will lay his ſervants exorbitances to his charge. So apt is the age to make Invectives againſt Authority, and to be Libellers againſt the Throne; every one will be examining a Princes foot-prints, and ſpying out ſtaines in the Robe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. That though the Scripture ſaith (and what is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to them with it under their armes, and upon their tongues ends?) that we muſt not ſpeak evil of Dignities, or curſe the King in our thoughts, yet there are men which will defame, and deprave, carpe, and curſe, yea they are not more violent, and virulent againſt any then Princes. But oh ſearch your own conſciences, and be not too ſearching into Princes lives, they are ſubject to many temptations, which never aſſaulted thee; the Court hath a thouſand inticements, which the Country do want. <hi>Aliud ſceptrum, aliud plectrum. The Scepter is one thing, the Minſtrels inſtrument is another thing.</hi> There is a great difference between a Princely life, and a private life. If thy Prince therefore be not abſolutely vicious, apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idolatrous, bear with common errours. How canſt thou expect him to be innocent, when thou thy ſelf muſt deprecate the curſe of thy daily treſpaſſes.

This is a ſtrange oath of allegiance where no fealty and loyalty is exhibited, would any Lord of a Mannour be contented with ſuch homage? that is a ſtrange ſtooping before a Prince, where the knee doth bow, and the heart doth ſtrive for ſuperiority, would any Father be ſatisfied with ſuch a proſtration from his child? what is this but to make Kings painted Giants? or to lead them up and down as Bearewards do their beaſts of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? yet how common a thing is it to ſee Liegemen act the Prince? they ſwear obedience to them, but all their ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is in laying their hands upon a book.

A good King doth love his Subjects too well, to tell them, that he would be a King of Bondmen, he is a baſe Subject, that will ſuffer his King to remain poor; and a King is too Noble, to think, that his chiefe Sovereignty is, to make his Subjects poor; Peſants may be ſo uſed, but Subjects every where, are not to be brought down ſo low, as to have no other veſt, but a Canvas-ſuit. They are no good Courtiers which hold this Paradox, they rather ſeek their own lucre, then their Princes luſtre; they are fitter to wait upon <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, then a Gracious Prince; if they loved their Princes Honour, as well as they do their own Intradoes, they would diſdain to expoſe their Prince to obloquy, to ſatisfie their own greedy, gripple deſires; but theſe are but the dregs; garbage, Lumbard, excrements, ſweepings, vervin, of a Court; a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Courtier doth ſcorn to ſalute ſuch, or to call them fellows; for he finds, that they are meer Horſe-leeches, Ferrets, Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, which thruſt themſelves into a Princes Service, to ſerve their own Intereſts: whoſe Faith is Fortune, and their Grace Greatneſs; they have little in them of a right Chriſtian, and nothing at all of a true Courtier; they would ſell the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for their own advantage, and bring him into a general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, for their particular Accrument: they will ſtir him up to pluck the whole Kingdom, that they may get the Feathers, &amp; to flay his Subjects like Beaſts, that they may have the profit of their skins.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119329:62"/> A knowing King doth deteſt ſuch, and an intelligent Courtier doth defy ſuch; for both theſe ſee, that they are but born for themſelves, that they tread inward, that they look not right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but are Goggle-eyed, looking onely to their own Coffers, <hi>famelici, tri-parci,</hi> meer Fleſh-flies, and Earth-worms, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to the King, and Stains to the ſplendid Courtier. <hi>What need have I of Mad men?</hi> ſo, what need hath a King of ſuch Selfiſh men? No; a Prudent King doth prize them onely, which adviſe him to maintain his People's Liberties, as well as his own Royalties. For a Prince is never more Glorious, then when he ſhines before the eyes of his People in the bright beams of gentle Uſage, and moderate Taxes. <hi>He, that Ruleth over men muſt be juſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3.</p>

I do not ſay, who built, and feaſted, burniſhed, and furniſhed more then the Merchant? but who relieved more Orphans, redeemed more Captives, founded more Hoſpitals, Schools, Churches, then the Generous, and Magnificent Merchant? The Merchant was one of the great Splendours, and Mirrours of the Nation. But alas, of late, how was Merchandiſe fallen into a Conſumption, her lungs waſted, her

But ſhall ſuch a famous Comforter of the Nation now dy of Melancholly? No, Merchant (ſaith ſuch a King) lift up thy head, thy Prudent Prince knows how uſeful thou art to the land, therefore he doth bid thee be of good cheer, thy Harpies are flown away, thy Fiends are diſpoſſeſſed, bring out thy wares, for thy Cuſtomers come throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Yea, remember the doom of the times, either partake, or take him to you Jaylour; either caſt in your lot; or caſt him into the hole. Oh how many of you for preſerving conſcience towards God, and fidelity to your Prince, that your names might not be blemiſhed, nor your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſcandalled nor your poſterities branded, have loſt your livelyhoods, and liberties, and been enthralled like Captives ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in warre, which did endure all the rage of mercileſſe Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rather then conſent to ſuch Jeſuitical, and Diabolical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes?

                        <label>6.</label> Sixthly, Come Enemies; who can caſt an eye on ſuch? I can look cheerfully upon you; who can exchange a word with ſuch? I can ſalute you; who can affect ſuch? I have a breaſt: for you; Who hath a hand for ſuch? I have armes to embrace you; Ye have been Enemies, your enmity was apparent, ye denied my Title, defied my Name, deprived me of my Revenue, ſlandered my Actions, took up Armes againſt me, and would have taken away my life; ye Beheaded the Father, and ſaid ye would have whipt the Son to death; and if your hands had been as long as your tongues I had been cut ſhort enough, ye would have been real Enemies, and made good your words to a title. Now who can pardon ſuch Enemies? I can paſſe an Act of Indemnity to them. Ye are Enemies, but ye have met with a meric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119329:71"/> Enemy, one that doth not deſire to be an Enemy, one that will not be an Enemy. Cannot I raze out of my breſt all theſe injuries, and indignities? Yes, I have a Princely heart of mine own, and ye ſhall finde the Princely operations of it; Your deſigne doth not exceed my Patience, nor your malice my Prudence; Ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me: but I will not baniſh you; Ye would have unkinged Me, but I will not unman you: if ye know how to forſake your errours, I know how to forgive them; If ye will but be peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I am not implacable; I would win you by clemency, I would reclaim you by Prudence; ye have been my blood-thirſty Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but I have not a blood-thirſty thought againſt you: I will not ſpill your blood, and my heart would bleed, if ye ſhould ſpill it your ſelves What mercy ſhould I have found at your hands, if I had fallen into your power? VVhat but mercy ſhall ye finde at my hands, now ye are in my power? Ye which have been barely my Enemies, I am no Enemy unto you; A man of fury and indignation would deſtroy you all, but a man of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Knowledge</hi> will preſerve you all; ye cannot have more guilt, then I have kindneſs; nor more crime then I have compaſſion. If ye can but repent for what ye have done, it ſhall never repent me, that I have ſaved the lives of my peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Enemies. It is baſeneſs to reproach a Reformed man for any of his former ſins, though never ſo grievous: who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <hi>Zacheus</hi> for his extortion, or Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, after their converſion? Muſt contrite Sinners thus be treated, and not contrite Enemies? Yes, my Humanity, and my Chriſtianity teach me how to relent, and to expreſs my ſelf indulgent, and to feel an obliterating heart towards my converted Enemies. A Gracious Prince doth not know how to revive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grievances, or to call you Enemies: your Prudent prince knows not how to feel the ſting of ill turns, or to ſeek revenge for them. See how I would gain your hearts by meekneſs, and break, or melt your hearts with Prudence. If ye can but ſay it was an irreligious attempt, I have Religion enough to bury it; if ye can but ſay, it was a Jeſuitical parallel, I have a Proteſtant heart to pardon it. Give Me but My own, and I give you your lives: give me but your knees, and I give you your necks. At what price went necks formerly? the price is much fallen. Though perhaps I could not have bought my neck of you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119329:72"/> for millions, yet ye may have your necks of Me under the price of a <hi>Sowze,</hi> or a <hi>Liver,</hi> even for the asking, even without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for I offer you them, if you will give Me but calme tongues, and cordial affections. Return to your duty, and your Prince doth return to you in favour; be not ye Malecontents, and I am pacified. Can you imagine lower terms for redintegration of affection? Was there ever Prince ſo highly provoked, ſo eaſily reconciled? What would ye have? Ye have my pacified Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and if that doth not ſatisfie you, ye have my Act of Pacification. Ye are invincible Enemies, if ye will not beleeve Me; ye are intractable, inveterate Enemies, if ye do not bleſs Me; Are ye not yet uſed like Natives? What would my Countrymen have? am I not yet kind enough? can ye wiſh me to be more amicable? Ye have my heart, and ye have my hand; my Princely favour is both ſignified, and ſigned; it is to be feared, that your many Princes uſed ſlippery arts with you, and were men of no fidelity, that your true Princes word doth carry ſo little credit with it; for what do ye ſtill doubt Me, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect me? ſhall there never be an end of fears, and jealouſies? am I yet too ſparing in expreſſions? how ſhould I perſwade you, that my lips are the true Embaſſadours of my heart. Indeed ſome think, that I have ſomething forgot my Mothe-tongue, that I cannot ſpeak readily French; but did not my Father, think you, teach me to ſpeak his countrey language? elſe why do ye complain of the <hi>Idiome?</hi> Have I not ſpoken plain Engliſh? If I have, why do ye not underſtand me? Why do ye not ſay that ye can require no more for plenary ſatisfaction? Why have you ſtil panick feares, that for all your Princes candid, and liquid unbreaſting of himſelf, ye ſay, or can ſay, that here is no quiet corner, this Land muſt not be taken up for our ſafe reſting place? Why not? What troubles you? are your hearts work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? are your feet ſtirring? will ye ſhun the ſight of your Prince? No, (ſaith ſuch a King) fly not my preſence, fly not out of the Nation; for except your own dreads chaſe you, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue you? except the Devil doth compel you to be gone, who doth eject you? no, keep your obedience, and keep your
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119329:72"/> ground. Your King bids you iive in the Land, live in his eye, live till (as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pollio</hi>) ye become gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed under his mercy. What now then, nothing but proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Rebels, ſearching abroad for Taytours, committing to Dungeons, holding up hands at the barrs of juſtice? Rackings, and Gibbetings in the Reign of ſuch a Prince? no, ſome wiſer then other ſome. An haſty, precipitate Prince might do this, but <hi>a man of underſtanding, and knowlege</hi> hath no ſuch ſpight, or rancour in him. There is not an haſty word heard, not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing Meſſenger ſent abroad, not a vindictive action appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all in another accent. They which were his own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are not ſo much as called Enemies, much leſs proſecuted as Enemies; except therefore they would have the Crown from his head, what would they have more from the head, and heart of ſuch a Milde, Mercifull Prince that weares the Crowne? After inteſtine warres, and bloody encounters, what is the iſſue? There is a reconciliation, all Friends, a generall Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty is paſt, the King, and his Enemies are at peace. There is not a man, which will hurt the King, there is not a man whom the King will harme; his Enemies will rather fall at his feet, then ſtrike at his head: and the King is readier to ſhed teares, then blood. The King may reſt in his Throne, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may reſt in their beds. Let them both reſt, and let not all the Machiavilians in the land, all the Jeſuites at Rome, all the Devils in Hell, be able to ſet them at variance. We have had a chargeable inſurrection, a diſmall warre, a laſting, and waſtng rent, but praiſed be the great over-ruling God; that he by an Heavenly providence hath brought in the right Heir, and by an Heavenly inſpiration hath knit the hearts of three Kingdoms to acknowledge this Heir, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King, and his faithfull Subjects are met, but the King, and his fierceſt Enemies are reconciled. Oh, vexation to the turbulent Polititians! Oh, torment to the State-troubling Jeſuites! Oh, the myſteries of Gods ſecret actings! Oh, the miracles of his unſearchable wiſdome. Conſider, and confeſs, ponder, and publiſh, recount, and record, weigh,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119329:73"/> and wonder, ſing for joy, and weep for joy. <hi>Ask now of the dayes that are paſt, ſince the day that God Created man upon earth: enquire from the one end of heaven to the other, if there came to paſſe ſuch a great thing as this, or whether any ſuch like thing hath been heard,</hi> Deut. 4.32. A King without the Land, and a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon voted never again to reign in the Land, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion filled with Swordmen, Pikemen, and Spearmen, to fight it out to the laſt drop of blood, rather then the deſigne ſhould fall to the ground, and yet in the exiled condition of the King, and againſt the deſperate Decrees of ſuch an Illegal, Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Depriving, Depraving, Depoſing, Decrowning Party, coming through the midſt of many, which had been ancient Enemies, not one lifting tongue, or weapon (that was generally known) either to oppoſe his entrance, or reſiſt his right, God (to aſtoniſhment) hath brought the King into the Land, and brought him to his Throne, ſetled him, and ſetled his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all things ſo miraculouſly ordered in Heaven, and ſo ſweetly compoſed upon earth, that all differences are ended in accord, and all jarres in embracements, that there are nothing but mutual, and reciprocall deſires, and vowes for one anothers welfare. Oh mercy mever to be forgotten! Oh miracle never enough to be admired; they require a Trophee, they deſerve an <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> yea, a volley of <hi>Hymns</hi> to celebrate them. Thus can the providence of God ſettle a diſtracted Nation, thus can the prudence of a King pacifie a diſpleaſed, diſtempered people, and turn Capital enmity by degrees into cordial unity. But to draw to a cloſe, a King that can be thus good to his Enemies, to whom will he not be benigne? I have ſhewn you how many ſhall have a ſenſe of his happy Government, and who may not have a ſhare of it? Yes, expect it one, expect it every one. I ſay no more, but that a Prudent Prince is extenſive in felicity, He is a bleſſing to a whole <hi>STATE. But by a man of underſtanding, and Knowledge, the STATE theref ſhall be prolonged.</hi>

Oh, when will ye ſee your Impietie? When will ye confeſſe it? When will ye weep for it? When will ye deſire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from it? When will ye waſh away the ſtain of it?

Our conſciences are but the ſuburbs of hell without it, for there is ſtill the guilt of nature upon us, and the Kingdom is but the ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-mark of Vengeance being void of it, for there is

No, I am but an hypocritical Teacher, if I do not crucifie my known corruptions, and ye are but counterfeit Hearers if ye do not purge your conſciences from dead workes. Oh therefore, I beſeech you all by the curſe of Nature, and dread of Judgement, by the ſhame of ſinne, and the fame of Converſion, by the ſtate of Adoption, and peace of conſcience, by the efficacy of Faith, and the evidence of a ſupernatural life, by the Union with Chriſt, and the communion of the Spirit, by your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preparation, and your dying confidence, by the quickning of your own ſoules, and the ſaving many a ſoul from death, by the bleſſing of your own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and the preſerving a whole Kingdom, that ye hate ſinne, and ſorrow to Repentance, that ye have a broken ſpirit and circumciſe your hearts, that ye take unto you words, and take away all grievances: that ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a vow, and obey from the heart, that ye hear the Voyce behind you, and ſtretch out your ſelves to that which is before you, that ye leave not an hoof behind you in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor ſuffer a ſpot to remain in the fleſh, that ye inſtantly, and intenſively, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly, and perfectly, kill all your corruptions, and clear all your convictions, ſo may ye not only burie all the curſes in your boſome, but interre all the miſeries of the Kingdom, that as the tranſgreſſion of the Land brought in <hi>Many Princes,</hi> ſo the Repentance of the Land may for ever keep them out. I never found my heart ſo awakened to the work as now, and would to God, that being rowſed my ſelf out of ſlumber, that I could raiſe you out of your dead ſleep. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> would to God that this were the day of his finding them up, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: for then what glad hearts, and a joyfull Kingdom might ye make: the men living, and the children unborn might bleſs you.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119329:87"/> and Land may proſper, for he is very ſenſible that his Subjects ſtock is his Bank, it being impoſſible (if there be not the height of tenaciouſneſſe, and ingratitude) that there can be a wanting Prince, where there is a flouriſhing people. In point of knowledge I do fear him but in one thing, and that it the firſt, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of his own Rites? but that he will not fail in for want of Knowledge, but through abundance of good nature; for I hear that he hath a heart ſo great, and an hand ſo liberal, that he will give Royalties to expreſſe Bounty; but this perhaps may be but a particular mans fear, my wiſe Prince in time may prove as great an Husband of his Rights, as others would have him a boundleſſe Diſtributer. But, if this ſhould be his errour, it were but his own injurie, and an exuberancy of an heroical and magnificent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Thus then I have now ſhewn you what your Prince is, and it is fit for every one to know the worth of his own Jewel: to honour a Prince is a part of loyaltie. <hi>Give honour to whom honour belongeth; Fear God and honour the King, Honour me before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaid</hi> Saul, <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>did not refuſe it.</hi> To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe more to a King then is due is flattery, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from a King, what he doth deſerve is Felony; And as there may be many Paraſites, ſo I doubt there are a great company of Crown-plunderers. What I have uttered, I intend rather for an Alarum-bel, then a Trumpet, for an Incentive, then a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, to quicken your thankfulneſſe, then to decipher my Princes perfections, and this I think is both duty, and conſcience. If he be ſuch a Prince then affect him, admire him, value him, reverence him. Think whit a miſerie ye had, what a bleſſing ye have; oh ſtrange alteration! Oh bleſſed change! Have ye a King? and ſuch a King? then do nothing to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Worth, to diſturbe his Government, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb facs="tcp:119329:87"/> his Rights, to injurie his perſon. Malicious is that eye which coth look upon him with ſpight, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous is that heart which doth envie his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and curſed is that hand that would aſſault his perſon. Would any one throw down that diſh by which he ſhould be fed? Pluck out that eye by which he ſhould ſee? Bruiſe that foot by which be ſhould walk? Clip out that Tongue by which he ſhould ſpeak? Stamp under foot that evidence by which he ſhould inherit? Rend in pieces that Garment wherewith he ſhould be cloathed? Burn that houſe wherein he ſhould dwell? abaſe, ſcorn, ſcandall, maligne, miſchieve, murther that King that ſhould make him happie both for bodie and ſoule? Is this the ſubjection to a King? Is this the obedience to a <hi>Man of Underſtandidg and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> God deliver us from ſuch loyal Subjects: here is horrid Allegiance. I beſeech you therefore by the remembrance of the <hi>Many Princes</hi> ye have had, and of the one Prince ye have, by the men of violent ſpirits, and politick heads, and by the <hi>Man of Underſtanding, and Knowledge,</hi> by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſlaverie, and your preſent libertie, by your Kings Right, and your Kings Graces, by your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymens welfare, and your Enemies watchfulneſſe, by the honour of obedience, and the ſhame of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, by the names of Subjects, and the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Saints, by the obligation of Oathes, and the commination of Gods Lawes, by the impartial Judges which ye feel in your own boſomes, and the incorrupt Judge which ye will meet with at the Throne, by the fruit ye deſire under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and by the comforts you expect upon your death-beds: that laying aſide all jealouſies, irefull paſſages, exaſperated paſſions, humours, and tumours, motions, and commotions, ye do bow before ſuch a King, and bleſſe God for ſuch a <hi>Man;</hi> Know his
<pb facs="tcp:119329:88"/> juſt Claim, and acknowledge his Perfections, pray for his proſperous Raign, and do what ye can to preſerve his precious, and ſacred Perſon? ſo may the King have ſafety, thy Kingdom proſperity, Religion Honour, the Church Unity, the Goſpel propagation, Faith Purity, the Nation may be preſerved, <hi>the State may be prolonged,</hi> and <hi>Upon all the Glory there may be a Defence:</hi> All which God grant for his mercies ſake. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
